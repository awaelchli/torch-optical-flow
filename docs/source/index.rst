Torch Optical Flow Documentation
================================

Torch Optical Flow is a toolbox for optical flow estimation with `PyTorch <https://pytorch.org/>`_.
It contains 

- functions for reading and writing common optical flow file formats
- tools for easy visualization
- loss functions, and common transforms (scale, warping, normalization, etc.) 
- implementations of baselines and state-of-the-art methods, with reproducible results and pretrained model weights
